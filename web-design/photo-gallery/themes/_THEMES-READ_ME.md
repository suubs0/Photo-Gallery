# Themes Read Me

In modern web design, a **theme** is a collection of PHP/HTML templates that define the look and functionality of a web site. 

The themes live in a special folder called, er, "themes". In Wordpress you can find them in wp-content. Each theme folder has its own fonts, css, javascript, style images and other resources. You can switch from one theme to another at any time without breaking the web site. The web site works independently of the theme, but it always needs one to be active.

Web designers write PHP templates with a concern for aesthetics, functionality, user experience and accessibility.
